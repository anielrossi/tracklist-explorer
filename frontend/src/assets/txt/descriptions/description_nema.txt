(Streamed originally on @rblmedia)

Here we are after another short break with a special 2 hours episode kindly hosted by the RBL crew in Turin.
Today's episode will see a special guest from Bologna in control for the first hour, and myself for the second one.

The guest's name is NEMA, he is one of the best DJ and selectors I've encountered in some time.
I met him for the first time on Discogs while trying to get my hands on some Ossia and Beau Wanzer gems he was selling, and from there we started a long and interesting conversation that would shape the fast and strong connection that brought us here today.
Furthermore, he's also a member of the infamous Mint Sound collective, one of Bologna's most solid realities around electronic music.

For the next two hours you are going to listen a strictly vinyl set by himself for the first 60 minutes, and some more tracks by myself on the second ones.
Thanks again RBL for the hospitality, in particular Giulio for the invitation and Stefania for making this possible. It is much appreciated.
Hope you enjoy it,
