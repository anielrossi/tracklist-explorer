𝖑𝖔𝖜-K is what I like to listen, play and feel. I don’t have a precise plan at the moment but I’m sure there will be plenty of low frequencies and mad rhythms.
I am particularly attracted by music that comes from the soundsystem culture and that has been pushed into the club scene developing various shapes and interpretations.
I’ll have the pleasure to invite some good friends of mine along the way as well, I can't wait 🙂 . It’s going to be fun, stay tuned 😈

This first mix is a warm welcome by myself. Tune in and make yourself (un)comfortable. Cheers.
