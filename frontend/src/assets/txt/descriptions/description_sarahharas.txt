Hello everyone and welcome back to 𝖑𝖔𝖜-K.
Today's guest is the super talented Sarah Haras straight from Bahrain.

I firstly discovered her on the Ma3azef(@ma3azef) ig page, where she is resident, 
when I got particularly attracted by a tracklist of her filled with extreme perreo energy from ladies like Bad Gyal and Rosalia. 
Loads of self-productions and music from amazing artists such as Deena Abdelwahed and Maral in there as well (just to name some).
That’s where my full support for her started.

Last year she represented Ma3azef on NTS and she was also part of the compilation they made with the track "Bliss".

This said, get ready for an hour of proper idm, deconstructed club, trap, reggaeton, pop, idontknowhowtodefinethem bangers.

Some unreleased stuff in here as well!!

Enjoy,

Sindrome
