I'm very glad to announce Althia in the mix for this week's 𝖑𝖔𝖜-K. 
After a long time invitation she finally managed to send me something between one trip and another. 
She is currently writing documentaries in the middle of the mountains and curating Transhumance, a monthly radio show on Radio Raheem, 
focused on experimental artists located outside the big cities and that often live in some remote corner of the world. Very recommended.

On a personal note she has also been the main guest of the second and last Symposium party almost two years ago sharing the decks with Double Precision and myself. 
Killer night. 

This said, I'll leave you to some refreshing bassy vibes perfect for welcoming the summer.

Cheers,

Sindrome
