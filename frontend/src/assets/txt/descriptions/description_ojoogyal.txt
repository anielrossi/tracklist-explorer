Hey there,
Welcome back to another episode of ùñëùñîùñú-K.
I'm super glad to welcome Ojoo Gyal in the guest mix for the next hour. 
She is an extremely active dj and she has played all over the most famous radio stations in the last couple of years.

I firstly bumped into her on ig with a clip of her playing one of my fav club tracks at the time called Desilu(U Edit) by Human Resources (go listen to it!) and the people in the club going crazy.

Right now, besides being resident on radios like Noods and Movement, she has also just started a new show on Kiosk Radio.

This said, I'll leave you to 60 min of rhythmic and melodic explorations going from kuduro to dub steppers and loads of low frequencies hanging around.
Enjoy,

Sindrome
