For this fourth episode I've invited one of my all time mentors.
The first pair of Technics I've touched are in his studio.  
He has influenced me in so many ways and he keeps doing it.

His name is Andrea, in art Yips, and he is one of the two members of the live act Camboja(@camboja). They curate a monthly show on the french radio Station Station. He is also co-founder of the London based experimental music collective and label Sagome(sagome.london).
