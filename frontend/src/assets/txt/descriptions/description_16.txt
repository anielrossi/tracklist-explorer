Hey there, welcome back to 𝖑𝖔𝖜-K.
More melodic than usual, a nice bunch of warm pads and plucks for these first cold days of autumn.  
I'm glad to open this special Thursday that sees the friends of Pho Bho Records jumping on board with us. It will be fun.

Oh, another picture from Anna(@llrmts) in the artwork, bless her.

Hope you enjoy,

Sindrome
