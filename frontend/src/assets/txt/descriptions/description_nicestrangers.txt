I'm super glad to have the amazing Nice Strangers on the show today. She is one of my favourite people both artistically and on a human level. OG in the radio world, she has crazy selection skills and she is literally capable of creating new atmospheres and outer world dimensions with her records. If you want to listen more, and you should, she is currently resident on Bristol's Noods Radio curating a top notch quality show that brings her name.

Ambient, tribal and experimental music are the keywords for the next hour, but get ready to find yourself in places that you've never imagined to visit before. 

Nice Strangers is Silvia Mal. Silvia is based in London where she co-runs the label and collective Sagome, which is, in my opinion, one of the best solid experimental music collectives at the moment.

Enough words for now, please get comfortable and let's enjoy this one together.
Peace,

Sindrome
