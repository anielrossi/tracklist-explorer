Hey there, happy to be on 00185fm again and back with 𝖑𝖔𝖜-K.

Today's guest is a friend of mine that goes by the name of ArtSaves. 
His music career started in Tehran in 2012, where nightclubs were prohibited by law and his performances used to happen within the confines of undisclosed parties. 
During the years he kept affirming himself as both producer and performer.

Last year he released his latest EP ‘Chimera’ under his own imprint Kopi / ک پ ی. 
‘Chimera’ compasses a melange of ambient and industrial techno, ambiguously drawing inspiration from Artsaves' Iranian heritage while targeting the concepts of identity, authenticity and belonging.

Up to today he is still contributing in pushing and amplifying the Tehran scene. 

Here you can find 1h of music selected and blended by him.
Enjoy,

Sindrome
