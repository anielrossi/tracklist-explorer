Welcome again on 𝖑𝖔𝖜-K this time with my brother Rubén aka @edulcorants.
Born, raised and living in Barcelona.

He has been one of my main persons while i was living there, i have so many beautiful memories of those days and nights. His consolle has actually been very gentle with me during that year. 
Super good selector, I'm glad that he managed to record a set for me, i've been waiting this for a long time.

So, without further ado, just get comfortable and enjoy an hour of dreamy and bubbly mood-refreshing UK hardcore vibes.

Peace,

Sindrome
