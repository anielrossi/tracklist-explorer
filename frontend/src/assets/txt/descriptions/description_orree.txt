I met Cesare a year ago in the smoking area of Plastic during a Mystic Visions party (shouts to the @mystic_visions boys). 
He had just moved from Rome to Milan and he was looking around. After a few words with him I understood that I could learn a lot from him.
That's still happening so I am glad to have him on 𝖑𝖔𝖜-K.

Roma est Since crew member and one of the pivotal figures of Rome's underground bass scene, Orre came back to me with this killer set full of swaggers and exclusive unreleased productions. 
You really don't want to miss this.
