Sebastiano Carghini aka Spirinet in the mix for this week's 𝖑𝖔𝖜-K.
AMAZING project in my opinion, I really dig his vibe and I am so glad to have him on the show.
Cannot wait for his forthcoming release on K-HOLE TRAX (should be in December).

The mix is a trip that starts somewhere than goes somewhere else and then somewhere else and than somewhere else....I would say a rollercoaster between a warm lo-fi taped vibe and some not-to-be-expected bangers to dance to. Some nostalgia plays its role as well here and there. 
Another killer guest mix on the show.
