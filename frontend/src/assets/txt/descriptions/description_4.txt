The 4th episode of 𝖑𝖔𝖜-K is a personal selection of beautiful music with plenty of organic sounds and drum machines. The intro is an amazing song by Rogér Fakhr from Habibi Funk’s compilation Solidarity with Beirut. Go check it out on Bandcamp, all the proceedings are going to the Lebanese Red Cross.
