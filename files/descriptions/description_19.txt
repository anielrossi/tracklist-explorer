Happy 2022 everyone :)
From now on 𝖑𝖔𝖜-K will be on a monthly base.
I'm sure that having more time to listen and collect music between episodes will bring a new flavour to everything. 
Another thing I'm sure of is that I still have tons of things to say and respectful people to invite over. 
Hang around,
