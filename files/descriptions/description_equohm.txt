Here we are, stepping into the 2021 with a super guest.
His name is Giacomo aka Equohm (@equohm) and he is the other half of the already-introduced-on-the-show Since Crew (@since-crew).

We met the first time at the Since Sofa Party when he and Cesare (@orree_man) invited me and Double Precision (@double_prec) to play as guests on their show on Noods, what a night.

For today he kindly sent me this tunnel of tribal psychedelic wrong speed stuff in which I entered and remembered my name again only one hour later.
With some juicy stuff from East Rome and some stunning unreleased bits from the members of the crew themselves get ready to roll for an entire hour.
Safe,

Sindrome
