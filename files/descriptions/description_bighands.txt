Hi everyone and welcome back to ùñëùñîùñú-K.

Today's guest is Big Hands, member of the Sobborghi crew that since many years has been spreading amazing music and events from Monza to London. 
During these years he also released some must have records on labels such as Blank Mind, Oscilla Sound and his own Baroque Sunburst. I personally own all of them and they are always in the easiest-to-pick section of my collection.
He is also behind the raising Graft project, a brand new reality that sees Sobborghi and the Since Crew teaming up together for a huge future contribute to the international soundsystem scene. If you follow the show you've already heard more than one unreleased bit from the label. I'm personally super hyped for the project and I really recommend you to keep an eye on it.
I'll leave you to an hour of tribal-ish and dub infused bass music that is always good for the spirit. 
Cheers,

Sindrome
