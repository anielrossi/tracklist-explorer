This week's guest is Matteo Coffetti, co-founder and co-runner of the Bergamo based label Pho Bho Records and Upstairs parties. 
These realities are characterized by a strong resilient vibe and that's what we like.
I am a huge fan of Pho Bho Records, I've already played on the show more than one track from it and people went crazy for them. If you play to a dancefloor they're a must have.

Matteo is a great dj and producer. 
I remember very well one time dancing at a set of his at Macao (without knowing him yet) and not leaving the dancefloor the whole time. 

This said, I'll leave you with 1 hour of straight downtempo and wrong speed vibes mixed by him.
Enjoy,
