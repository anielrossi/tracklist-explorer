This week's 𝖑𝖔𝖜-K sees Nodef going full force against Babylon and keeping the roots vibe solid. 

Nodef is the other half of my favourite duo named Camboja (together with Yips, which has been a guest on the show some months ago).
Since a few years now, he is curating the 00:00:02.50 show on Radio Banda Larga in Turin, pushing different kind of vibes gravitating around dub, techno and ambient. I really advise you to check it out on Soundcloud, it's top notch.

Back to us, what is really recommended now is just you to sit back, light one up and let it go.
