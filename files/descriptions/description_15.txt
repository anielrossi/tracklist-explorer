Welcome back to 𝖑𝖔𝖜-K, it's good to see you again.
I'm gassed for the start of this new season, a lot of good music will flow through and a lot of people will be involved.
I'm opening the season with this hour of records that I really like, some of them bought during the holidays and some of them long time favourite ones.
The picture this time is from Anna (@llrmts), an amazing photographer and a dear friend of mine.
Hope you enjoy,

Sindrome
