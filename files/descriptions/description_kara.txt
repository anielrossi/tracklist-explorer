Hey everyone,

I’m so glad to host Fabio aka Kara for this week’s 𝖑𝖔𝖜-K.

Guardian of the current @frittofm home, I’ve heard him for the first time closing the last Halloween party.
After hours of rage from the previous artists he was able to create an incredible melting vibe that got me swinging until the last moment. Not even 30 seconds after finishing his set, he received an invitation from me for being a guest on the show, and I’m so glad he accepted.

Nothing to add really, immediately one of my favourite DJs around..

I’ll leave you to his beautiful set.

Peace,

Sindrome
